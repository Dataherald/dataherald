Golden Records
=======================

In order to improve the perfromance of NL-to-SQL engines, our system includes a few verfied Question SQL samples in the prompts.
As more samples are verfied, the performance of the NL-to-SQL engine not only improves in terms of accuracy but also improves in terms speed.
The verfied Question SQL samples are called golden records. These golden records are stored in vector database for fast retrieval and also in our application storage for easy access and management.
