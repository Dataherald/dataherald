Vector Store Options
====================

In our system, we currently support two commonly used vector stores: ChromaDB and Pinecone. Each vector store offers distinct features and advantages that cater to different use cases.

ChromaDB
--------

ChromaDB is a powerful vector database that provides efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors. Its advantages include:

- **Local Storage**: ChromaDB stores vectors in a local database, ensuring fast access and low-latency queries.
- **Flexible Schema**: ChromaDB allows for flexible schema designs, making it suitable for a variety of vector types and applications.
- **Efficient Indexing**: ChromaDB employs advanced indexing techniques to accelerate vector similarity searches, enabling quick and accurate retrieval of similar vectors.

Pinecone
--------

Pinecone is a cloud-based vector search engine that specializes in delivering high-performance vector search capabilities. Its advantages include:

- **Scalability**: Pinecone offers seamless scalability, enabling you to handle large-scale vector datasets and dynamic workloads.
- **Real-time Search**: Pinecone is optimized for real-time vector search, making it suitable for applications that require low-latency retrieval of similar vectors.
- **API-Driven**: Pinecone provides a comprehensive API that allows you to integrate vector search capabilities into your applications with ease.

Abstract Vector Store Class
---------------------------

Both ChromaDB and Pinecone are implemented as subclasses of the abstract `VectorStore` class. This abstract class provides a unified interface for working with different vector store implementations.

:class:`VectorStore`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This abstract class defines the common methods that both ChromaDB and Pinecone vector stores should implement.

.. method:: __init__(self, system: System)

   Initializes the vector store instance.

.. method:: query(self, query_texts: List[str], db_alias: str, collection: str, num_results: int) -> list

   Executes a query to retrieve similar vectors from the vector store.

.. method:: create_collection(self, collection: str)

   Creates a new collection within the vector store.

.. method:: add_record(self, documents: str, collection: str, metadata: Any, ids: List = None)

   Adds vectors along with metadata to a specified collection.

.. method:: delete_record(self, collection: str, id: str)

   Deletes a vector record from a collection.

.. method:: delete_collection(self, collection: str)

   Deletes a collection from the vector store.

By utilizing the `VectorStore` abstract class, you can seamlessly switch between different vector store implementations while maintaining consistent interaction with the underlying systems.
