Support

The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the #crawler
channel on Freenode.
We hang out there and you can get real-time help with your projects.
The other good way is to open an issue on Github.

The mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crawler 
is also available for support.
