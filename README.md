Dataherald is a natural language-to-SQL engine built for enterprise-level question answering over relational data. It allows you to set up an API from your database that can answer questions in plain English. You can use Dataherald to:

- Allow business users to get insights from the data warehouse without going through a data analyst
- Enable Q+A from your production DBs inside your SaaS application
- Create a ChatGPT plug-in from your proprietary data

This repository contains four components under `/services` which can be used together to set up an end-to-end Dataherald deployment:

1. Engine: The core natural language-to-SQL engine. If you would like to use the dataherald API without users or authentication, running the engine will suffice.
2. Enterprise: The application API layer which adds authentication, organizations and users, and other business logic to Dataherald. 
3. Admin-console: The front-end component of Dataherald which allows a GUI for configuration and observability. You will need to run both engine and enterprise for the admin-console to work.
4. Slack: A slackbot which allows users from a slack channel to interact with dataherald. Requires both engine and enterprise to run.

For more information on each component, please take a look at their `README.md` files.
