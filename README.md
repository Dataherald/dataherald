## Overview

###Background

LLMs are a phenomenal piece of technology, and the latest models have gotten very good at writing SQL. However we could not get existing frameworks to work with our structured data at a level which we could incorporate into our application. That is why we built and released this engine. 

###Goals

Dataherald is built to:

- Be easy to set up and add context
- Be able to answer complex queries
- Get better with usage
- Be fast


## Get Started

The simplest way to set up Dataherald is to use to create a managed deployment with a hosted API. We are rolling this service to select customers. Sign up for the waitlist <link>.

You can also self-host the engine locally.
