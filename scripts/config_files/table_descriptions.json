    "description": "The purpose of this table is to record a daily snapshot of the firms positions along with PL (Profit and Loss), Attribution, Exposure, Alpha and advisor tags and other factors. There are 4 funds in the firm Rockhampton, Yaraka and Canoona, with the following respective codes RH, YA and CA. Some columns like Attribution, Alpha, SectorAlpha and Exposure are prefixed with the fund codes. Unless a value column augmentd with _USD the value is assumed to be in JPY. Some performance indicators: TPX Sector Alpha: Attribution - (Exposure * TPX Sector return), Alpha: Attribution - (Exposure * Beta * TPX return), Outperformance (Outperform/OP): Attribution - (Exposure * TPX return). If side is S then values will need to be multiplied by -1 if calculating the net but not for gross. If someone asked what is the attribution, alpha or exposure without specifying fund, the values per fund should be returned. If someone mentions (fund) RPA they are referring to LR.",
